    Probably the most misused and abused and disused management tool in history is the performance<br>
    appraisal. It's the strangest thing. Ask any manager or hman resources person whether they think<br>
    performance appraisal is an important thing to do, they are almost unanimous. ""Of course it is", is the<br>
    common response. If you ask why it's important, they will tell you and tell you and tell you.<br>
    The odd thing is that they often don't get done, and managers, supervisors and employees hate the<br>
    darned things. Human resource professionals spend a lot of time whipping people into doing them,<br>
    while managers look for a variety of reasons to delay and delay. Why is that?<br>
    It's uncomfortable to do performance appraisals. But why is it uncomfortable? Because people<br>
    undertake them for the wrong reasons and wrong perspective, which ends up putting the manager and<br>
    the employee on different "sides". Appraisals are used for determining pay increases, who gets let go,<br>
    who gets promoted. Often they are used to focus on what people have done wrong.<br>
    So what is the point of performance appraisals? Here's a starting point that actually works. <span class="boldtext"> The most<br>
    important purpose or goal of the appraisal is to improve performance in the future</span>...and not just<br>
    for the employee. Managers can get valuable information from employees to help them<br>
    make employee's jobs more productive. Work units and organizations can identify problems that interfere<br>
    with everyone's work.<br>
    If we shift from affixing blame, to identifying barriers to performance we begin to remove the fear and<br>
    dread people have about these "appraisals". When we focus on the present and the future, we change<br>
    our focus to what's been to what can be better tomorrw.<br>
    An appraisal that works involves a number of things, but first and foremost is the process of identifying<br>
    what has gotten in the way of better performance (regardless of the level of performance), and how<br>
    manager and employee can work together in the future, to improve it. It's really that simple.<br>
    When managers put away the "blaming stick" in appraisals and move to a cooperative, dialogue<br>
    approach, the whole process can become more comfortable and effective. Because, it puts the manager<br>
    and employee on the same side, and working towards the same goals, getting better and better.<br>
    Sure, we do use appraisals for a number of reasons but if we are going to get real value out of the time<br>
    and energy we put into them, we have to look at the process in a more constructive way. And, bottom<br>
    line, that's making performance better.
