	<span class="changefontitalic">Lecture clash </span>training.<br>
	Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they can be manageable. Here are<br>
	some thoughts on how to deal with it:
	<ul class="textwrapper">
		<li>Realise that it is up to you. You are responsible for making it work</li>
		<li>Attend one lecture and get notes from the other (start with the web noes, but that is not<br>
		enough)
		</li>
		<li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's<br>
		not on the web
		</li>
		<li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:
		<ul class="textwrapper">
			<li>
				If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of three<br>
				that's 33%
			</li>
			<li>Which one are you most on top of</li>
			<li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</li>
		</ul>
		<li>
			Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture@. If you didn't miss anything,<br>
			there would be no point in lectures.
		</li>
	</ul>
